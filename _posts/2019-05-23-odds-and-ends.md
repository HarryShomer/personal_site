Just finished the semester and I have a little time on my hands so I figured I'd highlight a few things:

1. I decided to shut down indefinitely OffsideReview. For those who don't know, OffsideReview was an NHL statistics website I ran. It contained player and team statistics for the past three years, focusing on more "modern" numbers. I'm going to reevaluate in a few months to see if I want to bring the site back for next season. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/HarryShomer/OffsideReview). 

2. For the past two semesters I worked on my Senior Honors Thesis in school. It was titled "Classifying Sculptures by Art Style using Convolutional Neural Networks". In a nutshell, there has been a fair amount of work over the past 5-7 years focused on art visual recognition. That is, trying to classify art objects into a discrete set of classes based on their visual features. A vast majority of the work has been on paintings, classifying them by style, artist, and genre. In contrast very little work has been done classifying sculptures, with none doing so by style or using deep-learning techniques (such as CNNs). So the goal of my research was to extend the previous work done classifying paintings by style to sculptures.

   For those interested, the code can be found [here](https://github.com/HarryShomer/Sculpture-Period-Classification) (my full thesis is also in there if for some reason you want to read it). I also created a little [web app](http://sculpture-app.harryshomer.com/) where you can upload an image of a sculpture and get the probability that it belongs to each class. It also contains a brief description of the methodology and results.

3. I can't remember the third thing I meant to mention so I guess that's it.
