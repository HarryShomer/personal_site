I currently work as a Data Analyst at Hearts & Science. I graduated in 2019 from Brooklyn College (CUNY) with a B.S. in Computer Science. My Senior Honors Thesis was on assessing how well we can classify sculptures by art style using convolutional neural networks (more information can be found [here](http://sculpture-app.harryshomer.com/)). 

If you are interested in some of my work please check out both my [projects page](projects.md) and my posts for a detailed look at the stuff I've worked on.
