I'm currently a senior at Brooklyn College (CUNY) studying Computer Science. My interests 
include machine learning, data science, and specifically how we can apply them both to hockey analysis.

If you are interested in some of my work please check out both my [projects page](projects.md) 
and my posts for a detailed look at the stuff I've worked on.
